# DCF Model in Py
*new
## Usage

1. Edit financial assumptions in `config.py` (see the `DCF_CONFIG` dictionary).
2. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python dcf_model.py
   ```

## Customization

To change key assumptions (e.g., revenue growth rate, margins, discount rate), update the values in `config.py`.
