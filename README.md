# DCF Model in Py
This project runs a simple Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis in Python.

## Usage

1. Edit financial assumptions in `config.py` (see the `DCF_CONFIG` dictionary).
2. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python dcf_model.py
   ```

## Customization

To change key assumptions (e.g., revenue growth rate, margins, discount rate), update the values in `config.py`.

This project is for learning as I just started intersecting Py with finance specifically modeling. If there are any suggestions or improvements, feel free to let me know!
